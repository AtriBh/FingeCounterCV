# Finger Counter with Mediapipe

This project is a simple finger counter built using Mediapipe, which recognizes hand signs and displays corresponding 2D images on the screen. If you show a "one" sign with your hand, the program will display an image of the number "1." Similarly, if you show a "two" sign, it will display two images of the number "2."

## Features

- **Hand Sign Recognition**: Detects hand signs using Mediapipe Landmarks.
- **Dynamic Display**: Displays corresponding 2D images based on the detected hand sign.

## Installation

Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AtriBh/FingeCounterCV.git
   ```


## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python finger_counter.py
   ```
2. Show your hand in front of the camera with a specific sign (1, 2, etc.).
3. Watch as the corresponding number of images appear on the screen.
